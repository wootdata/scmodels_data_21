Description             : Custom Model for Half-Life

And Special Thanks      : CGP for doing such a great job on this model for Q3 and
                          for DocRock and BabyKitKat for inspiring me as always!
=============================================================================

This model was origionally created for Quake3 by CGP in April of 2000.

I extracted and converted the model to HLDM for BabyKitKat because she's
a kick and this is an awesome model.

The changes made are quite extensive since I started with only the basic mesh
and textures. The mesh is all contorted into a pose as is usual with Q3 models
(now WHY do they do that?).

All bones, animations and many cleanups on the mesh and textures took several
days worth of work before they all finally came together and worked, WhooHoo!

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2, Wally, Photostyler,
mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and decompiling, mesh, texture, skeleton and animation work
was done in Milkshape 1.6.5 (whew, and boy what a job it was!).

Info:

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file and the original from CGP is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache (it already has a nice one!)
or remove the clothes from it (ARGH!) and release it to the world as yours,
IE: don't be lame. (thanks to NSi for the notice).
