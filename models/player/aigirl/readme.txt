aigirl.mdl

Modeled by: Scooter
Unzip Folder: aigirl <i.e. players/aigirl>

Just unzip into the players/aigirl directory and have fun.

This was my first attempt at making a model.  It is based on the Rewolf model aigirl.mdl use in Gunman Chronicles.

The technicals:

The skin came from the Rewolf aigirl.mdl, and was stretched, bent and twisted using a demo version of Milkshape.  Some other changes to the model were using custom scripts (mostly because I was too lazy to figure out how to make things happen in Milkshape).

I asked Rewolf for permission to distribute this model.  Rewolf has said that this model can be freely distributed on two conditions:

1.  Rewolf is credited with the original model (i.e. this text file must be with the model).
2.  The model is used for Half-Life only.
